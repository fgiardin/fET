# extract data from LDAS data products

# PATH is the directory where all the NetCDF files from one product (e.g. NLDAS or GLDAS) are stored
# LAYER is the layer of the product you want to extract
# for GLDAS: Rainf_tavg, Evap_tavg, PotEvap_tavg, Rainf_f_tavg
# for NLDAS: PEVAP, APCP

# the function automatically tries to extract the variable (specified as 'layer')
# at the specified fluxnet2015 location (it returns NA if the location is outside of
# the NetCDF) and create a dataframe in the right format

# !!! for LDAS still need to transform to one value per day (it's hourly total data)
# GLDAS NOAH: 3 hours resolution
